Objective:   

Netflix is one of top streaming services which offers a wide variety of award-winning tv shows, movies, original content and much more. Our group analysis will explore Netflix dataset through visualizations and graphs using python libraries and five answers to trends among four genres:  Action, Horror, Documentary, and Comedy.   

 Further, we will review the following:  

    Quantity of each genre (how many)  
    Quality of each genre (IMDb average rating)  
    Which movie was the most popular for Netflix for the specific genre (TMDB)  
    Which actor/actress was most featured for the specific genre

Instructions: 

    Use Pandas to clean and format your dataset or datasets. 
    Create a Jupyter notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process. 
    Create a Jupyter notebook illustrating the final data analysis. 
    Use Matplotlib to create 6 to 8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least 2 visualizations per “question” that you ask your data). 
    Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team—and for inclusion in your presentation. 
    Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each “question” that you asked your data as well as a short description of your findings and any relevant plots. 

    Bonus: Use at least one API—if you can find one with data pertinent to your primary research questions. 

 
Presentation Requirements: 

Team will prepare a formal 10-minute presentation that covers the following topics: 
    Questions that you found interesting and what motivated you to answer them 
    Where and how we found the data we used to answer these questions 
    The data exploration and cleanup process (accompanied by your Jupyter notebook) 
    The analysis process (accompanied by your Jupyter notebook) 
    Our conclusions, including a numerical summary and visualizations of the summary 
    The implications of our findings: what do our findings mean?
